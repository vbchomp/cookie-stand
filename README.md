### Reflections and Comments

- What motivates adults to find time for their learning in their busy schedule? I've kind of cheated and waited until my kid was out of the house and all but my husband and animals needed my attention. My husband works swing shift and only misses me by a couple hours. So this is the perfect time to facilitate my learning. I just wish it had happened earlier in my career when my brain might have been more focused.

- Lab 7. Created a constructor to dynamically create stores and properties to caluclate the sales of cookies. Having trouble getting the footer to work. I'll have to do more googling. I like how the table sizing is limited to 50% to account for how I've put in the logo.

- Lab 8a. Wireframes seemed very easy to construct until I tried to implement them into my pages. So I decided I will try to use them in my next projects and not bother trying to get them in now.

- Lab 8b. Getting lost in all the CSS across all the different pages. Tryong to keep track of which list item is which is tough. Not sure design is a strong skill I have.

- Looking at YouTube videos now on how to do 2d arrays so that I can start my cookies per hour over. I think I got lost in my variables and need a clean slate to get the totals rows to work. Besides...Practice!!!

- Lab 9. Lots of new stuff to learn. I was initially comfortable with forms and events then realized my table was not updating the footer. Luckily, Ryan was able to save the day and help me, bsaically re-write my renderFooter function to allow it to re-write. I had my hours and locations arrays flip flopped so that creating my for loops was more difficult. So, I just need to remember that which ever array is on the y axis is the slow array and will be the one on the outside for loop.
